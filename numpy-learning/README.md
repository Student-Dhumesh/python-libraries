# NumPy Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that document my learning journey with **NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical computing.

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `array.ipynb` | Introduction to NumPy arrays: creating, types, and basic attributes. |
| `array_indexing.ipynb` | Techniques for indexing, slicing, and accessing array elements. |
| `array_operations.ipynb` | Performing arithmetic, statistical, and broadcasting operations on arrays. |
| `exercises.ipynb` | Practice exercises to reinforce concepts learned in previous notebooks. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Student-Dhumesh/python-libraries.git
cd python-libraries/numpy-learning
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Mac/Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```


4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code, open the notebook you want to explore, and run the cells step by step.

```
jupyter notebook
```

This repository is meant for learning purposes.

Notebooks may contain outputs for reference or be cleared for clean code review.
